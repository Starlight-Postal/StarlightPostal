  scriptIntro:
  - Well hey there kiddo, you must be my transfer.
  - "Welcome to Autumn Outpost, I\u2019m Captain."
  - It might not look like much, but this is kind of the central hub for all of Starlight
    Mountain! Only way in or out is through this station.
  - "Well I\u2019m sure you know, but you\u2019ll be our new mail carrier for the
    season. \u2018Whole mountain is serviced by this postal service, so it\u2019s
    a big responsibility!"
  - "I won\u2019t bore you with the details, we\u2019ve got a big night ahead of
    us. This week\u2019s mail just came in, we gotta get going."
  - "I hope you got some shut-eye on the train because your first shift starts right
    now! I\u2019ll give you a minute to get settled but when you\u2019re ready to
    go, meet me out back."
  - 
  scriptBalloon:
  - Hey kiddo, all set?
  - "This is it, the Starlight Express! She\u2019s a real beauty."
  - "What\u2019s the matter, never flown a hot air balloon before? How else did you
    think all those packages made it to the summit?"
  - "Well, I\u2019m a big believer in learning by experience. Press SPACE to hop
    in!"
  - "Now a hot air balloon is about the simplest kind of vehicle you\u2019ll ever
    drive. There\u2019s only two directions: up and down!"
  - We go up by heating up the air in the balloon, tap W to use your burner.
  - "There you go! The hotter our little air bubble gets, the higher up it\u2019ll
    want to float. Be careful though, she might take a minute to get up as high as
    she wants to go, so there\u2019s no need to floor the burner."
  - Little taps will usually do the trick!
  - Now to go DOWN, we need to vent some of that hot air out the top. Tap S to open
    the vent.
  - "Nice job! Be gentle with her, we don\u2019t want to be rocketing up and down."
  - Ballooning is all about your ups and downs, side-to-side is more of a challenge.
  - "We can always lean the balloon with A or D, but that\u2019ll only get you so
    far. A master balloon pilot needs to learn to follow the wind."
  - Pay attention to your surroundings! See how the leaves are blowing in all different
    directions?
  - Think about the direction you want to go, and see if you can find a wind current
    that can take you that way. Be like the leaves!
  - "Well here we are, this is our first stop. Let\u2019s make our way to the landing
    platform!"
  - "Easy does it now, let\u2019s make it a gentle landing."
  - Now in order to dock here we need to be tied down. Press E to drop the anchor.
  - "Whoops, we need to anchor to the landing platform! Press E again to retract
    the anchor. Let\u2019s try again, make sure you\u2019re over the target."
  - Nice job! Now lower the balloon closer to the groud. Then we can press SPACE
    again to hop out.
  - "Great work kiddo, you survived your maiden voyage! Let\u2019s get to the post
    office- we\u2019ve got some packages to deliver."
  - 
  scriptPostOffice:
  - This is the Autumn Hills post office, every town will have their own branch.
  scriptPostOfficeDelivery:
  - Well that's that! All that's left here is to deliver that package.
  - Good luck, kiddo, I'll be town at the tavern.
  - 
  scriptBar:
  - Hey sport, still looking for the mayor?
  - They might be at the state house, just east of the post office.
  scriptDelivered:
  - Good work kiddo, you better get going. There's a lot more mail to deliver tonight!
